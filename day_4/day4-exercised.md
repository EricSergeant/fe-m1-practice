1. In an image element, why is the alt attribute important? It's a description of the image used to add explanation for viewers who can't see the image.  Critical for blind/vision impairments.

2. What determines if an image element is inline or block?Â If the image is followed by a block element (such as a paragraph) then the image will be block.  If it's within an element, it will appear as inline (page 101).

3. What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?  GIF or PNG are useful when few colors or large areas of the same color.  JPG is best for images with lots of colors.

1. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?  It can help the page load more smoothly as it loads HTML and CSS before the images and will know how much space to leave for an image while it goes on to render the rest of the page.  It can also standardize sizes in a site, such as products in a grid.

2. What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?  A single image used for several parts of an interface, such as a button.  It's useful for saving load time since the browser only needs to request one image rather than several.
