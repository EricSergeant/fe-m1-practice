# User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)

[UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals](http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals).

Read the first three, short posts:
1. What is UX?  The goal of a UX designer is to make users effective.
2. What are user Goals & Business Goals? User goals are what the users want to get out of the use of the platform/content. Business goals are the reasons the business has for producing the platform/content.
3. What are the 5 Main Ingredients of UX?  
  - Psychology
  - Usability
  - Design
  - Copywriting
  - Analysis

After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your day7-exercises.md file.

### Psychology
Q: How does this make them feel?
Pro Site: wikipedia.com (if you're interested in learning, it's a never-ending hole to fall down, in a good way)
Anti Site: berkshirehathaway.com (so much money, so sad for a website) 

### Usability
Q: Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
Pro Site: www.twitter.com (simple "Happening now" and "Join Twitter Today".  You can sign up or log in.)
Anti Site: github.com (It has the "learn" section front and center, but there's a lot of additional and confusing information.  Perhaps due to focus on the brand of being for developers.)

### Design
Q: Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
Pro Site: google.com (it's a search bar and no ads)
Anti Site: htmlcolorcodes.com (I like the site but it has a lot of words and explanation on the landing page that could probably be better found on subpages.)

### Copywriting
Q: Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
Pro Site:  news.google.com (Has a clear listing of headings where text gets less bold and smaller depending on whether it's acting as a heading, title, or source)
Anti Site: codepen.io (mostly seems like all font is the same size, though some variety between menu and submenu.)

### Analysis
Q: How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
Pro Site: amazon.com (I don't know much about their analytics but they clearly have a robust system to match people with potential purchases)
Anti Site: drivethrurpg.com (Doesn't seem to be collecting good information and making good product matches.)
